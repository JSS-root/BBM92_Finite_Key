# BBM92_Finite_Key

Code base for the BBM92 finite key analysis protocol. This project numerically implements a finite-key solver for the BBM92 protocols.

Maximisation is performed using both direct optimisation and brute force approaches to enable user suitable tradeoffs in runtime.

Translation of code to Python pending and under development.
